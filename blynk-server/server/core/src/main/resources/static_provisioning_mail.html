Hi there,<br>
<br>
Nice app you made with Blynk for {project_name}!<br>
<br>
Here is what's next:<br>

<ul>
    <li>Find the QR code attached. If your app can connect to more than one device, there will be QR codes for every device. Learn <a href="http://help.blynk.cc/publishing-apps-made-with-blynk/1240196-provisioning-products-with-auth-tokens/static-auth-token-provisioning">how Static Device Provisioning works</a>.</li>

    <li>Since you chose Static Device Provisioning, you need to pre-flash every device with Auth Token: {DYNAMIC_SECTION}</li>
</ul>

<b>If you would like to publish your app to App Store and Google Play, check out our <a href="https://www.blynk.io/plans/">plans</a> and send a request.</b><br>
