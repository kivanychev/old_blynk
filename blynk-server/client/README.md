## App Client (emulates Smartphone App)

+ To emulate the Smartphone App client:

        java -jar client-${PUT_LATEST_VERSION_HERE}.jar -mode app -host localhost -port 9443


+ In this client: register new user and/or login with the same credentials

        register username@example.com UserPassword
        login username@example.com UserPassword


+ Save profile with simple dashboard

        createDash {"id":1, "name":"My Dashboard", "boardType":"UNO"}


+ Get the Auth Token for hardware (e.g Arduino)

        getToken 1

+ Activate dashboard

        activate 1

+ You will get server response similar to this:

    	00:05:18.100 TRACE  - Incomming : GetTokenMessage{id=30825, command=GET_TOKEN, length=32, body='33bcbe756b994a6768494d55d1543c74'}

Where `33bcbe756b994a6768494d55d1543c74` is your Auth Token.

## Hardware Client (emulates Hardware)

+ Start new client and use received Auth Token to login

    	java -jar client-${PUT_LATEST_VERSION_HERE}.jar -mode hardware -host localhost -port 8442
    	login 33bcbe756b994a6768494d55d1543c74
   

You can run as many clients as you want. You have only 15 seconds for login until your client will be disconnected from server, 
so hurry up :).

Clients with the same credentials and Auth Token are grouped into one Session and can send messages to each other.
All clientâ€™s commands are human-friendly, so you don't have to remember the codes.
